# Elementary

This is a simple tableview based application that hits an API endpoint that fetches data on the elements of the periodic table. Tapping an element's cell will display a details page with a graphical UI and additional details about the element. All code included has been written by me, the owner of this repository, with the exception of a small extension to handle color conversion from hex to an RGB UIColor object.
